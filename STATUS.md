## Next Tasks (Priority)

1. **Game title** - Display "SAKTRIS" somewhere on the game screen (small is ok)
2. **Collision VFX** - Add spark/particle effects when pieces collide during physics bump
3. **Piece visuals** - Make pieces look more 3D with shading (skins optional/future)
4. **Drag and drop** - Allow dragging pieces to move them (keep click-to-select as alternative)
