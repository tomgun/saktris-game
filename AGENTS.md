## Non-negotiables
- Add/update tests for new or changed logic.
- Keep `CONTEXT_PACK.md` current when architecture changes.
- Keep `PRODUCT.md` up to date with decisions and completed capabilities.
- Add to `HUMAN_NEEDED.md` when you are blocked.
- Keep `JOURNAL.md` current (session summaries).
- If this repo uses the Core+Product profile: keep `STATUS.md` and `/spec/*` truthful.
