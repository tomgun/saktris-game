## Purpose & Context

### Why This Project Exists
[Describe the problem, opportunity, or need this project addresses. What inspired it? What gap does it fill?]

### Who It's For
[Primary users, stakeholders, or beneficiaries. Include personas if helpful.]

### Success Looks Like
[Define what "done" means. What outcomes, metrics, or achievements would make this project successful?]

## Core Vision

### What We're Building
[High-level description of the product/system. What is it? What does it do?]

### Key Value Propositions
[The 3-5 most important benefits or differentiators. Why would someone choose this over alternatives?]

1. **[Value 1]**: [Description]
2. **[Value 2]**: [Description]
3. **[Value 3]**: [Description]

### Not in Scope (For Now)
[Explicitly list what this project will NOT do, at least initially. This helps maintain focus.]

## User Scenarios

### Primary Use Cases
[Describe 2-4 core scenarios where users interact with the product. Focus on the "happy path."]

**Scenario 1: [Title]**
- User: [Who]
- Goal: [What they want to achieve]
- Flow: [High-level steps]
- Outcome: [What happens]

**Scenario 2: [Title]**
- User: [Who]
- Goal: [What they want to achieve]
- Flow: [High-level steps]
- Outcome: [What happens]

### Edge Cases / Future Scenarios
[Scenarios that are important but not MVP, or edge cases to consider.]

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
[Platform requirements, technology limitations, performance targets, etc.]

### Business Constraints
[Budget, timeline, regulatory requirements, market deadlines, etc.]

### Assumptions
[What are we assuming to be true? What could invalidate this vision?]

---

## Initial Tech Direction

### Proposed Stack
[High-level technology choices, if known. This can change during initialization.]

- **Frontend:** [e.g., React, Vue, native iOS/Android]
- **Backend:** [e.g., Node.js, Python, Go]
- **Database:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite]
- **Hosting:** [e.g., AWS, Vercel, on-premise]

### Key Technical Risks
[What technical challenges or unknowns exist? What needs research?]

---

## Open Questions

[List unresolved questions that need answers before or during development.]

1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

---

## Next Steps

[What happens after this vision is defined? Typically: framework initialization, PRD creation, tech research.]

1. Initialize Agentic AI Framework (run `.agentic/init/init_playbook.md`)
2. Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)
3. Define initial features in `spec/FEATURES.md`
4. Set up repository and development environment

**Note:** This document is meant to be living. Update it as the vision evolves or assumptions change. Once the project is initialized, this vision will inform the PRD and feature specs.
