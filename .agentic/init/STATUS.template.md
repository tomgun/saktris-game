# STATUS.md

<!-- format: status-v1.0.0 -->

Purpose: the living "truth" of where the project is today.

## Quick Context
<!-- 1-2 sentences: What is this project? (See PRODUCT.md for details if it exists) -->


## Project Phase

<!-- Two phases: discovery (figuring out what to build) or building (iteratively building it) -->

- **Phase**: discovery  <!-- discovery | building -->
- **Focus**: <!-- What's the current focus within this phase? -->

<!--
Discovery: figuring out what to build
  - Research, references, examples
  - Requirements gathering
  - Initial designs/mockups
  - Feasibility exploration

Building: iteratively building it
  - Specs, designs, code, tests evolve together
  - No separate "testing phase" - testing is continuous
-->
