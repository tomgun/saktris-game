# PRODUCT.md (Optional)

<!--
This is an OPTIONAL vision document describing WHAT you're building.
For day-to-day project status (WHERE you are), see STATUS.md (required).

Use PRODUCT.md when you need:
- Detailed product description
- Capability tracking with checkboxes
- Scope definitions (in/out of scope)
- Technical approach documentation

You can delete this file if you don't need it - STATUS.md is sufficient for project tracking.
-->

Purpose: what we're building, what's done, and what's next. No ceremony, no IDs, just shared context for humans + agents.
