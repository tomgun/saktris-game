## Agent Workflow for Commercial Services

### When Agent Needs an Asset

**Updated workflow** to include commercial services:

1. **Check if asset already exists**:
   - Look in `assets/images/`, `assets/audio/`, etc.
   - Check `assets/ATTRIBUTION.md` for existing assets

2. **If asset doesn't exist, ask human**:
   ```
   "I need [description] for [feature].
   
   Options:
   a) Source from FREE library (Unsplash/Kenney/Freesound)
   b) Generate with FREE AI (Stable Diffusion/AudioCraft)
   c) Use COMMERCIAL service (if you have subscription)
   d) Use placeholder for now
   e) You'll provide it
   
   Which would you prefer?"
   ```

3. **If human chooses (c) - Commercial Service**:
   ```
   Agent: "Which commercial services do you have access to?
   
   Images:
   - Adobe Stock subscription?
   - Shutterstock subscription?
   - Envato Elements subscription? (BEST VALUE - unlimited!)
   - Midjourney subscription? (AI generation)
   
   Music/SFX:
   - Artlist subscription?
   - Epidemic Sound subscription?
   - Envato Elements? (includes music + SFX)
   
   3D/Video:
   - TurboSquid credits?
   - RunwayML subscription?
   
   Let me know which you have, and I'll guide you to find the right asset."
   ```

4. **Agent provides specific search guidance**:
   ```
   Agent: "Great! You have Envato Elements.
   
   For [fantasy game background music]:
   1. Go to: https://elements.envato.com/audio
   2. Search: 'fantasy adventure orchestral game'
   3. Filter: Music > Game Music > Fantasy
   4. Recommended tracks:
      - 'Epic Fantasy Quest' by MusicAuthor
      - 'Medieval Adventure' by SoundArtist
   5. Download and save to: assets/audio/music/background-fantasy.mp3
   6. I'll add to ATTRIBUTION.md
   
   Envato Elements license:
   - ✅ Commercial use allowed
   - ✅ Attribution NOT required (but I'll note source)
   - ✅ Perpetual license"
   ```

5. **If human chooses (a), (b), (d), or (e)**: Follow existing workflow

| **CC-BY-NC** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Non-commercial only! |
| **MIT / Apache** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (in LICENSE) | ✅ Yes | Common for code/fonts |
| **OFL (fonts)** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Open Font License |

**🚨 RED FLAGS - DO NOT USE**:
- ❌ CC-BY-NC (Non-Commercial) - unless project is non-commercial
- ❌ CC-BY-ND (No Derivatives) - cannot modify
- ❌ "All Rights Reserved" - not free to use
- ❌ No license specified - UNSAFE, ask human

## Integration Checklist

To fully implement media asset workflow support:

- [ ] Add `assets/` and `design/` directories to scaffold.sh
- [ ] Create `assets/ATTRIBUTION.md` template
- [ ] Update `agent_operating_guidelines.md` with asset sourcing workflow
- [ ] Add media asset section to `HUMAN_NEEDED.md` template
- [ ] Update `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` with asset management workflow
- [ ] Create examples in example projects (game with sprites, web app with images)
- [ ] Add license checking script (`validate_attribution.py`)

**Status**: PLANNED (not yet implemented)

---

## Tools for Future Integration

### Asset Management
- **Asset library manager**: Track assets, licenses, usage
- **Automated attribution**: Generate CREDITS.txt from ATTRIBUTION.md

### AI Generation Integration
- **Stable Diffusion API**: Programmatic image generation
- **AudioCraft API**: Programmatic sound generation
- **Batch generation**: Generate multiple variations

### License Validation
- **License checker script**: Validate all assets have proper attribution
- **CI/CD check**: Fail build if ATTRIBUTION.md missing entries
- **License compatibility**: Warn if conflicting licenses
