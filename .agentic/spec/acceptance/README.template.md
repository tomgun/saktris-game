# Acceptance criteria & acceptance tests

Purpose: keep acceptance criteria for each feature in a consistent location, and document how to validate it.

## Convention
- One file per feature: `spec/acceptance/F-0001.md`
- Link from `spec/FEATURES.md` to the acceptance file.

## What belongs here
- Acceptance criteria written in plain language
- Example scenarios / edge cases
- If tests exist: where they live and how to run them (or a TODO)
