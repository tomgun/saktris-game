# Docs (system documentation)

Purpose: long-lived “how the software works” documentation.

## Recommended reading order
1. `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. `docs/operations/RUNBOOK.md` (if applicable)
3. `docs/debugging/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## Conventions
- Keep docs concise and actionable.
- Prefer links to source code and specs rather than duplicating truth.
