# Stack profiles

These are short guidance documents used during init to speed up filling `STACK.md` and choosing the right testing approach.

## How to use
- Pick the closest profile and follow its checklist.
- Copy any relevant bullets into `STACK.md` and `/spec/TECH_SPEC.md`.
- If your project evolves, update `STACK.md` and (if it’s a real decision) write an ADR.

## Available profiles
- `generic_default.md`: safe defaults for most projects
- `webapp_fullstack.md`: typical webapp + backend
- `juce_vstplugin.md`: JUCE-based VST/AU plugin considerations
- `mobile_ios.md`: native iOS app considerations
- `backend_go_service.md`: Go backend service
- `ml_python_project.md`: Python machine learning project
- `systems_rust.md`: Rust systems programming
- `mobile_react_native.md`: React Native cross-platform mobile app
