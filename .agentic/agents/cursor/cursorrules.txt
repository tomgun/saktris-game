You are working in a repo that uses the agentic development framework (folder: .agentic/).

Always consult:
- AGENTS.md (if present)
- CONTEXT_PACK.md
- STATUS.md
- /spec/* and spec/adr/* as the source of truth

Rules:
- Add/update tests for new/changed logic.
- Update STATUS.md after meaningful progress.
- Keep changes small and scoped.

Token-efficient scripts (USE THESE, don't edit files directly):
- JOURNAL.md: bash .agentic/tools/journal.sh "Topic" "Done" "Next" "Blockers"
- STATUS.md: bash .agentic/tools/status.sh focus "Task"
- HUMAN_NEEDED.md: bash .agentic/tools/blocker.sh add "Title" "type" "Details"
- FEATURES.md: bash .agentic/tools/feature.sh F-#### status shipped
