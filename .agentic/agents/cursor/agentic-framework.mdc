# Agentic framework (Cursor rules)

You are working in a repo that uses the `.agentic/` agentic development framework.

## Always read first
- `AGENTS.md` (if present)
- `CONTEXT_PACK.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `spec/OVERVIEW.md`
- `spec/FEATURES.md`
- `spec/NFR.md` (if constraints apply)
- Relevant `/spec/*` sections, including `spec/acceptance/F-####.md` for the feature you are changing

## Must-follow behavior
- Follow `.agentic/agents/shared/agent_operating_guidelines.md`.
- **Follow programming standards**: `.agentic/quality/programming_standards.md`
  - Security first (validate input, parameterized queries, no hardcoded secrets)
  - Clear naming (descriptive, not cryptic)
  - Small functions (<50 lines)
  - Explicit error handling
- **Follow testing standards**: `.agentic/quality/test_strategy.md`
  - Test happy path, edge cases, invalid input
  - Test time-based behavior with mock clocks
  - Use descriptive test names
- Keep changes small; prefer incremental diffs.
- Add/update tests for new/changed logic.
- Update `STATUS.md` after progress and keep specs truthful.

## Developer UX
- Always end with: what changed, what's next, and what you need from the user.
