# Session Start Prompt

I'm starting a new coding session on this project, which uses the Agentic AI Framework.

Please help me get oriented by:

1. Reading `.continue-here.md` (if it exists) for quick context
2. Checking `HUMAN_NEEDED.md` for any blockers requiring my attention
3. Reviewing recent work in `JOURNAL.md` (last 2-3 entries)
4. Identifying the current focus from `STATUS.md` or `PRODUCT.md`
5. For Core+PM mode: Check for active features in `spec/FEATURES.md` (status: in_progress)

Then provide a brief summary of:
- Where we left off
- Any blockers or decisions needed
- What makes sense to work on next
- Any quality or validation checks that should be run

Finally, ask me what I'd like to focus on in this session.

**Framework Guidelines:**
- Follow `.agentic/agents/shared/agent_operating_guidelines.md`
- Use checklists in `.agentic/checklists/`
- Prioritize Test-Driven Development (write tests first)
- Keep documentation (JOURNAL.md, STATUS.md/PRODUCT.md, specs) updated in the same commit as code
- Run quality checks before committing
