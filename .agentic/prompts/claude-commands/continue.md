description: Resume work from STATUS.md checkpoint
---

I want to resume work on this project.

Please:

1. Read `STATUS.md` for current project state and focus
2. Check `.agentic-state/WIP.md` for any interrupted work
3. Read `HUMAN_NEEDED.md` for active blockers
4. Review `JOURNAL.md` (last 2-3 entries) for recent history

Present a summary of:
- Where we left off
- Current focus
- Active blockers
- Recommended next steps

Then ask me what I'd like to work on.

**Context files to check:**
- `STATUS.md` (current state and focus)
- `.agentic-state/WIP.md` (interrupted work)
- `HUMAN_NEEDED.md` (blockers)
- `JOURNAL.md` (recent history)
