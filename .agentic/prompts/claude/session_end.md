# Session End Prompt

I'm wrapping up this coding session. Please help me document what was done:

1. Update `JOURNAL.md` with:
   - Date and session summary
   - Features/tasks worked on
   - Decisions made
   - Problems encountered and solutions
   - Next steps or open questions

2. Update `STATUS.md`:
   - Current focus/next steps
   - Overall progress state
   - Any new insights or changes

3. For Core+PM mode: Update `spec/FEATURES.md`:
   - Change feature status if appropriate (planned → in_progress → shipped)
   - Update implementation state (none → partial → complete)
   - Add new code file paths
   - Update test coverage status

4. Check if anything should be added to `HUMAN_NEEDED.md`:
   - Decisions requiring business context
   - Unclear requirements
   - Trade-offs needing human judgment

5. Verify git status is clean:
   - All changes committed with descriptive messages
   - No untracked files (or explain why they exist)

6. Provide a brief summary of:
   - What was accomplished
   - What's ready for the next session
   - Any important notes or warnings
