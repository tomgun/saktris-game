# F-0012: PhysicsBumpMode

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Captured pieces bump off
- Captured piece flies off board in direction of capture
- Physics-based motion with gravity

### AC2: Collision detection
- Bumping pieces collide with board pieces
- Collisions nudge board pieces

### AC3: Collision sparks
- Particle effects spawn at collision points
- Golden/orange spark colors

### AC4: Collision sounds
- Sound plays on piece collisions

### AC5: Motion trails
- Long-distance slider moves show motion trails
- Trails fade over time

### AC6: Setting toggle
- Physics bump can be enabled/disabled
- Setting persists

## Test Notes
- Visual/manual testing
- Verify performance (60 FPS maintained)
