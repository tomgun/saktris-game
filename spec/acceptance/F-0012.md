# F-0012: PhysicsBumpMode

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Bump Animation
- Pieces slide to new positions with smooth tween animation
- Collision sparks appear when pieces bump into each other
- Motion trails visible for long-distance slider moves

### AC2: Collision Detection
- Pieces detect when they collide during movement
- Recent collision tracking prevents spark spam
- Sparks spawn at collision point

### AC3: Physics in Action Mode
- Bump mechanic works when back row is full during piece arrival
- Column shifts pieces toward opponent
- Furthest piece falls off if column is completely full

### AC4: Visual Feedback
- Bump animations are smooth (no teleporting)
- Collision sparks are visible but not overwhelming
- Motion trails fade naturally

## Test Notes
- Manual testing: observe bump animations during action mode auto-placement
- Verify sparks appear on collisions during rapid play
