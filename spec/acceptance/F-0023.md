# F-0023: Online Action Mode Fixes & Ready Button

## Summary
Fix multiple issues with online action mode: cooldown bar positioning, game mode sync between players, add random side option, and add a "Ready" button so both players confirm before action mode begins.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Bug Fixes
- [x] AC1: Action mode cooldown bars reposition correctly when board resizes (no longer stuck in middle)
- [x] AC2: Host's game style (Classic/Action) is sent to guest — both players get the same mode
- [x] AC3: Guest uses host's game_mode from settings, not their local Settings.game_style

### Random Side
- [x] AC4: Side selector shows White, Black, and Random options
- [x] AC5: Random is the default selection
- [x] AC6: Random resolves to White or Black before room creation (consistent everywhere)

### Ready Button (Online Action Mode)
- [x] AC7: In online action mode, a prominent "I'm Ready!" button overlay appears after game loads
- [x] AC8: Action mode timers are paused until both players are ready
- [x] AC9: Pressing "I'm Ready!" sends ready signal to opponent and shows "Waiting for opponent..."
- [x] AC10: Game begins (timers start) only after both players have confirmed ready
- [x] AC11: Non-action online games are unaffected (no ready overlay)
